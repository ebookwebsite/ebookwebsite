      In his book Unscripted, MJ DeMarco claims that most people can't achieve
      financial success because they have unproductive beliefs about money that
      dissuade them from pursuing an entrepreneurial path. However, he argues
      that though these beliefs are pervasive, they're surmountable.

      Thinking fast and slow shows us that our mind is composed of two systems.
      System 1 works instinctively and requires very little effort; System 2
      works more meticulously and requires more concentration. Our thoughts and
      actions change depending on which system is controlling the brain at the
      time.
